# NeoVim Config

100% Lua config ðŸ¥³

This is very much a work in progress. As someone coming from heavy use of VSCode
this config aims to bring many familiar utils and handy features into vim mainly
for C#/Unity, Typescript and Rust development.

## Why not just use VSCode?

Well I really like the idea of vim and think the customizability and speed that
you can achieve with it is quite amazing but every time I gave it a go, I always
felt like I was trying to force it. Using VSCode's vim plugin always felt like I
was trying to get it to do something it didn't want to. It was close but never
perfect. However this time I bit the bullet and went for a complete vim solution
and this is what I ended up with so far.
